shellcheck.net
==============

ShellCheck's live demo website. Try it out on [shellcheck.net](http://www.shellcheck.net).

To run locally, clone and build [koalaman/ace](https://github.com/koalaman/ace)
and copy ace/build/src as libace here.  Note that src trees from the
[ace-builds](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/) repository will *not*
function completely, if at all.

A local test server can be run with `php -S localhost:8000` provided `php >= 5.4.0`.
